# Work-Day-Scheduler

This project was generated using CSS, Javascript (JQuery), and HTML.

The purpose of this project was to provide a simple work day scheduler for users (8-5, hours that I work). The scheduler has numerous simple features. Those feature include a time clock with the current date located at the top of the page for organization, timeblocks that indicate whether the desired hour is in the past, present, or future. In addition, there are convienant text boxes where users can enter in the event that they desire to remember. Once the user enters in text and clicks the save button, the text will be save to the users local storage.
